# things-to-do-instead-of-this
This is really just a public page that I can point at to track things I can do that don't waste my life. A lot of this is from my "habit tracking" but not all

* Do your work! It's actually pretty interesting!

* Self care
  * Flossing
  * Play Ring Fit Adventure - close your green and red rings!
  * Do my ankle exercises so I don't get hurt again
  * Meditate for 15 minutes
  * Take a nap
  
* Home care
  * Clean the kitchen
  * Clean part of the house - attic and dining room are current focus areas

* Self-improvement
  * Study Japanese for 30 minutes
  * Write in your journal - track your life!
